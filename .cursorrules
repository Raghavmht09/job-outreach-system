# B-MAD Project Rules

## Core Principles
1. **Reference Documentation**: Always reference PRD and Architecture documents before implementing any feature.
2. **Story Format**: Follow the story format from B-MAD for all code changes and commits.
3. **Type Safety**: strict mode is enabled. No `any` types unless absolutely necessary and documented.
4. **Testing**: Include unit tests for all features.
