# 6. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| **Google API Ban** | Critical | Use "Safe Search" patterns. Cache results. Use multiple API keys if needed. |
| **LinkedIn Structure Change** | High | Extension uses broad DOM selectors (heuristic) rather than brittle class names. |
| **Claude Cost Spike** | Medium | Set hard monthly spend limit in Anthropic console ($50). |
| **User Trust** | Medium | Always show "Diff View" so users see exactly what changed in their resume. |
