Job wants: "Product Manager"
You have: "Project Manager" or "Business Analyst"

Strategy:
- Emphasize product decisions you made
- Highlight cross-functional leadership
- Show user/customer focus
- De-emphasize execution-only work

Example transformation:
BEFORE: "Managed project timeline and resources"
AFTER: "Led product roadmap prioritization based on user research, working with engineering and design to ship features that increased engagement 30%"

---

### Pattern 3: Industry Pivot

Job wants: Healthcare experience
You have: Fintech experience

Strategy:
- Focus on transferable skills (PM skills, not domain)
- Emphasize similar problems (compliance, security, etc.)
- Show quick learning ability
- Research their space and reference it

Add to summary:
"While my experience is in fintech, I've successfully navigated [similar challenge they face], and am excited to apply [transferable skill] to healthcare."

---

### Pattern 4: Level Up

Job wants: Senior PM
You have: PM experience (but not "senior")

Strategy:
- Emphasize leadership and strategy
- Show scope of impact
- Highlight mentoring/influencing
- Frame achievements at higher level

Reframe bullets:

AFTER: "Defined product strategy for [area], leading team of 3 PMs to deliver [outcome]"

</resume_patterns>

<meta_guidance>

Resume tailoring principles:It's not lying, it's framing:
- Same facts, different emphasis
- Highlight what matters to them
- De-emphasize what doesn't

Use their language:
- They say "clients" → you say "clients" (not "customers")
- They say "Agile" → mention Agile (not just "iterative")
- They say "growth" → emphasize growth metrics

Metrics matter:
- "Increased engagement" = vague
- "Increased engagement 40% in 6 months" = concrete
- Even rough estimates better than nothing

Don't keyword stuff:
- Yes: Naturally work in relevant terms
- No: "Python Python Python experienced Python developer"

One resume per job:
- Generic resume gets generic results
- Takes 20 minutes to tailor
- 3x better response rate

Remember:
Goal is to get the interview.
Once you're in the room, your skills speak for themselves.

The resume just has to get you in the room.

## EMAIL COMPONENTS

### The Subject Line

Good subjects:
- "Quick favor - [Company] PM role"
- "[Mutual connection] suggested I reach out"
- "Fellow [background] - exploring [Company]"

Bad subjects:
- "Help!" (vague)
- "Referral please" (demanding)

---

### The Opening

"Hope you're doing well! [Personal touch about them or shared memory]"

If acquaintance:
"Hope this isn't too out of the blue - we [context of how you met]"

If cold:
"I'm reaching out as a [shared background] - found you through [source]"

---

### The Ask

Make it clear and low-friction:Good asks:
- "Would you be comfortable giving me a referral?"
- "Would you be open to referring me if you think I'd be a good fit?"
- "Could I get 15 minutes to learn about the role and potentially ask for a referral?"

Bad asks:
- "Can you help me get a job?" (too vague)

---

### The Graceful Out

"Either way, appreciate you considering it."

Why this matters:
- Removes pressure
- Makes them more likely to help

---

Here's my info:
- Resume: [attach or link]
- LinkedIn: [link]
- Job posting: [link]

Let me know if you need anything else. Thanks again!"

---

- [Option 3]

Or feel free to send a calendar link if that's easier."

---

### If they don't respond:

Wait 1 week, then:

"Hi [Name],

Just bumping this up in case it got buried. Totally understand if you're busy or prefer not to - no worries at all!

[Your name]"

One follow-up max. Then let it go.

---

### If they say no:

Thanks again,
[Your name]"

Maintain relationship, don't burn bridge

</email_framework>

<meta_guidance>

Real talk about referrals:Referrals work:
- 5-10x higher chance of interview
- Worth the awkwardness
- Most people want to help

Relationship matters:
- Close friend: Direct ask, informal
- Acquaintance: Coffee first, referral second
- Cold: Very low expectations, focus on learning

Make it easy for them:
- Clear subject line
- Brief email (<150 words)
- Specific ask
- All info ready (resume, link)
- Easy to say no

Don't:
- Send without context
- Ask multiple people at same company
- Be pushy about timeline
- Follow up more than once
- Take rejection personally

Timing:
- Ask before you apply (referral works better)
- Give them 2-3 days to respond
- One follow-up after 1 week
- Then move on

Remember:

Most people say yes.
But some will say no.
That's okay.

One good referral > ten perfect emails.

Send it and move on.
